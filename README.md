# Applying Bayesian Statistics and MCMC to Diabetes Risk Prediction

Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. If not properly managed, it can lead to severe health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, blindness, and amputations. Early detection of diabetes is crucial as it allows for timely intervention and management, which can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals and reduce the overall burden on healthcare systems.

The chosen dataset contains medical and demographic data of patients along with their diabetes status, whether positive or negative. It consists of various features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust Bayesian predictive model capable of accurately determining whether a patient has diabetes based on their medical and demographic data.
